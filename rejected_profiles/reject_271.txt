Enhancement of AODV Routing Protocol for sparse Adhoc Networks(
Dec'11-June'12 )

Improvement of an existing AODV Routing protocol has been done. We used
a technique called Store and Forward method to deliver the messages to
destination when source and destination are not connected. We also
developed a module which extends AODV in case of partially connected
networks.
