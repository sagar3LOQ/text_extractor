Career Objective

To explore potentials, develop and implement technical and analytical
skills towards professional as well as organizational advancement.

Professional Experience

1. Currently working as Senior Development Engineer with Pramati
Technologies.

2.  31 Months of professional experience in Hewlett-Packard IPG R&D
working as a Software Developer. 

Experience Summary

Project: CastlightHealth

Description: Castlightâ€™s Enterprise Healthcare Cloud provides
employers with a complete set of products and services for effective
healthcare management and employee care. Castlight Health tool is
through a business to business based subscription model. Only employees
of companies which have purchased subscriptions are allowed access to
Castlight Health's pool of pricing data

Technologies and tools used: Java, Junit, Mockito, Spring DI, Mysql,
Mybatis, Jenkins, Jira, Mongo DB, Velocity template, SOA, Restful API.

Project: Asgard (Open source)

Duration: 5 Months

Description: Asgard is a web interface for application deployments and
cloud management in Amazon Web Services (AWS). It was initially
developed by netflix to support aws and we have leveraged the same
capabilities for other cloud providers like openstack and rackspace.

Technologies and tools used: Amazon Web Services SDK, Openstack, Groovy
on Grails, Rackspace, Jclouds API. 

Project: Intelligent Cross-Sell

Duration: 3 Months

Description: Intelligent Cross-Sell, a service that allows merchants to
automate and optimize the targeting of cross-sells and upsells.
Intelligent Cross-Sell is integrated with CNET Content Solutions of more
than 5 million technology and consumer-electronics products, enabling
automatic compatibility-checking of recommendations and targeting by key
selling features. Intelligent Cross-Sell also supports behavioral data
for example, recommending based on people who bought this also bought
that and a site's proprietary attributes such as average user-review
score or product profitability.

Technologies and tools used: Core Java, Servlets, JSP, Junit, Mockito,
Sprint Dependency Injection, JDBC, JavaScript, ProtoType, JSF,
Elastic-search, Velocity Templates, Quartz Schdulars.

Project: HP ePrint (Cloud Print)

Description:  The primary use cases of the cloud print platform are, 

rinter owner registers her/his printer with the cloud,  the printer
owner is presented with the printerâ€™s Email Id. Then the user can send
 print request to the printer by sending an E-Mail. Cloud print platform
renders the content of the Email along with the attachment in to the
printer understandable format and sends it to the printer. Then Content
will get  printed on the printer. 

Printing of documents by sending an Email to the printer through a smart
phone or any device supporting sending Emails. This avoids the printer
dependency on Printer Driver and computer, user can print on any printer
from his mobile/computer with out Print driver or any setup. This
enables printing of a document through the mobile networks from any
remote locations.

Rendering of content for SIPS (Simple Internet Printing Apps) basic
printers. These printers can have print apps(SIPS) on the UI, user can
print the document from these print apps (i.e Sudoku, Disney, Comics).

Cloud Print Rest API's are used by other services like Google print,
Apple, Copouns.

Module : ePrint Cloud Rendering

Duration: 1 year 8 months 

Role & Responsibilities: 

Responsible for designing and implementing an executable code solution
which converts documents from one format to another format.

Testing the resulting components, and analyzing runtime profiles to
debug errors that might exist.

Responsible for creating and maintaining the overall structure and
layout of a software system's components and their interfaces within and
outside of the system.

Involved system level and component and Integration testing.

Written all the code with complete unit test coverage.

Reached the time to time deadlines and supported the project for more
than three releases.

Provided rendering as a Service by using Restful webservices.\

Module Description: Rendering is the core engine in Cloud Printing where
the submitted documents will be converted to a printer understandable
format. Rendering Component will be called during Job Flow by Print Job
Processor. When Rendering gets called different Transformers are
orchestrated depending upon the input format, output format and printer
family to which the output is generated.

Work Description: To transform a document into the output format
specified a series of transformations are performed like a chain. A
transformers output is given as input to the next transformation in the
chain and it continues until the current transformation does not have a
successor. Each transformation will accept a set of processing
attributes (document properties + device properties) that will be
applied where ever possible. This works similar
toÂ Chain-Of-Responsibility design pattern.

Technologies and tools used: Core Java, Testng, Junit, Mockito, iText,
Ghost Script, Webkit, XML, Eclipse, Mysql, Rest webservices.

Module: ePrint PJP (Print Job Processer) and Large Format Printer Device
enablement

Duration: 6 Months

Role & Responsibilities:

Responsible for defaulting and validating the print job attributes based
on Printer type and family. 

Responsible for making the Java Rest based web service calls to connect
to the various components across the cloud platform.

Written all the code with complete unit test coverage.

Involved in making the dynamic calls to the different components based
on the user request

involved in complete enablement of the Large Format Printers like
Mercury, AmperXL with cloud services.

Module Description: Print work flow mainly validates and defaults the
client input and it provides the interfaces to communicate with the
other modules like JEF, Offramp, Onramp.

Work Description: 	

PJP is a virtual Printer on the Cloud.

Exposes a well defined API to create and submit Job and check Job
Status.

Abstracts transformations, rendering technologies and provides API to
its clients in the cloud service.

Creates Job Workflows and monitors the rendering health parameters.

Uses JEF services to execute the Job flows and Channel services to
notifyÂ device.

Technologies and tools used: Core-Java, Annotations, Testng, Junit,
Mockito, Hibernates, MySQL, Spring IOC, Log4j, Rest based web services.

Module: ePrint Online Print Job submitter tool

Duration: 2 Months 

Work Description: Dynamic generation of security token by accessing
printer DB and submitting rest based request for preview, print, Scan,
and Render requests.

Technologies and tools used: Core Java, JSP, Servlets , XML, HTML, Java
Script, Multi threading, SQL.

Mini Improvement and projects:

Image Validator:

Description: HP Cloud Print restricts the small size low quality images
to avoid photo printing. So I have developed an online tool to validate
the images base on the image quality and other image properties. This is
very useful to the testers and developers to verify the Images before
they process for cloud print.

Technologies and tools used: Core Java, JSP, Servlets , XML, HTML, Multi
threading, SQL.

Technical Proficiency: 

Operating System : Linux and Windows

Database : MySQL

Programming technologies : JAVA, JDBC, JSP, Servlets, Hibernate, iText,
Junit, Testng, Mockito, EasyMock,Restful web service frame works .
