investigating transactions that are pended / queued for the following
reasons like Over Limit, Security and Duplicate Transaction. The project
also addresses the functions required to efficiently manage the queues,
create new queues, integrate the workflow process and Compliance
Analytics, and generate management and queue metrics reports. 

It involves interaction with several backend components. 

UNISYS - keeps the all sensitive information about transactions
conducted by consumers. 

Apache MQ - Batch Process is run periodically on UNISYS which retrieves
erroneous transactions, determines the process and pushes it to the
respective MQ. 

IBPM - It is a workflow engine which gathers workflow data by executing
workflow activities for a process instance created from the process
taken from the queue listeners. It interacts with several interfaces to
update the work request information in UNISYS. 

LDAP - makes the application secure by providing authentication and
authorization services. 

External Interfaces to UNISYS (RSI and Property) : makes loose coupling
with 

UNISYS and retrieves the requested information effectively.

Alternate catalogs are used to organize and classify collections of
items. An Alternate Catalog consists of a hierarchy of alternate catalog
categories, each containing items assigned to the Alternate Category.Â 
You can define any number of catalogs and assign an item to more than on
catalog.Â  Currently Oracle E-Business suite shares a common data model
to support Oracle SCM, CRM, Financials and HCM applications areas. The
next generation Fusion Applications will align the common data model to
include Seibel CRM. 

The common product model needs to provide the ability to support
defining multiple sales catalogs, provide a mechanism for releasing when
these sales catalogs are available to end users through Effectively as
well as releasing these catalogs. Additionally catalog security needs to
be provided in order to control access to these catalogs during product
selection and configuration during order capture, quoting or other
transactions that require product selection. Other capabilities would
include the ability to provide images, collateral/literature and display
templates for presentation and display purposes of these sales catalogs.
Users should also be able to import and export these sales catalogs as
well syndicate them to other systems consuming catalogs for other
operational purposes.

Project: ChimeraÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â       
   Technical Lead 

Description:

Chimera is the United Health middleware platform for the creation,
testing and execution of business rules and analytics. Chimera provides
a high performance, robust, flexible and rapid to use platform to
support business in responding to market requirements quickly. Chimera
consists of two main elements.

Chimera Optimized rules execution system (CORES) :

The CORES is the component that performs the processing required by the
business. This application typically reads input from a source, enriches
it with some business rules, and then persists the data to one or more
destinations. The CORES provides a number of input and output components
that make read and writing data straight forward. The CORES also
provides a number of administrative tools that enable process
monitoring, process enhancement, termination, error management and other
facilities. An important part of CORES is that it provides several
convenient and powerful deployment options out of the box.

Chimera Application and Rules Store (CARS):

Typically at the outset of a project rules will be written using IBM
Decision Center. However this powerful tool provides very little
guidance to the business user. The CARS is the Chimera solution that
provides a stripped down, easy to use environment for a business user to
add additional rules and artifacts to a pre-built ruleset.

Role:

      Played key developer and technical lead roles in team and
contributed to the end to end development release of chimera.

Responsibilities:

    

Involved in end to end development of chimera components from scratch
