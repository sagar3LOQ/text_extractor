		Project Summary:

             The Advance Commercial Information (ACI) program introduces more effective risk management processes and tools to identify threats to our health, safety, and security prior to the arrival of cargo and conveyances in Canada.

	Marine Mode: The Advance Commercial Information (ACI) Program requires marine carriers to electronically transmit marine cargo data to the CBSA 24 hours prior to loading cargo at a foreign port (including the U.S.). If the voyage is less than 24 hours in duration, the cargo and conveyance data must be reported at the time of departure from the foreign port.  This requirement allows the CBSA to effectively identify threats to Canada's health, safety, and security prior to the arrival of cargo and conveyances in Canada.

	Air Mode: The Advance Commercial Information (ACI) Program requires all air carriers and freight forwarders, where applicable, to electronically transmit conveyance, cargo and supplementary cargo data to the CBSA four hours prior to arrival in Canada. If the flight is less than four hours in duration, conveyance, cargo and supplementary cargo data must be reported at the time of departure from the foreign airport. This requirement allows the CBSA to effectively identify threats to Canada's health, safety and security before 
the arrival of cargo and conveyances in Canada.

	eManifest: will require the electronic transmission of advance cargo and conveyance information       from carriers for all highway and rail shipments. In addition, the electronic transmission of advance secondary data will be required from freight forwarders and the electronic transmission of advance importer data will be required from importers or brokers.
