Quillpad is the flagship product of the company, which is a transliteration software to type in regional
languages. We parallalized training algorithm of transliteration engine and speeded it up by a factor
of 8640 using CUDA API. I also built an app for sending SMSs in regional languages using Quillpad
engine for J2ME and Blackberry platforms.
– Built font rendering engine that dynamically generates bitmap images for words in regional languages to handle the absence of unicode fonts in mobiles.
– Designed and developed automatic font detection and conversion algorithm for non-unicode fonts
– Built mobile client for Teamtalk messenger by extending Protobuf to support nested classes, vector
of objects and enumeration.
– Developed android app which can generate sudoku from newspaper images of the game.
– Implemented a Blackberry app which improves energy savings by adjusting temperature of thermostat based on GPS co-ordinates.

January 2008 -

I learnt semantic parsing of free word order languages using Paninian framework under Prof. Rajeev
Sangal and Prof. Dipti Mishra Sharma. I am part of Semantic Parsing Team, which developed Indian
Language tools for POS tagging and chunking, building verb frames and dependency tree generation
and conversion to phrase structure tree.
– Developed scoring mechanism for ranking parse tress using soft constraints with weights. Weights
of these constraints are calculated by applying estimation maximization on annotated Hindi corpus.
– Built tool for semi-automated classification of verb frames for hindi corpus using seed verb frames.
