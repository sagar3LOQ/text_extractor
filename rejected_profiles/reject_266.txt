PROJECT EXPERIENCE:

# Project 1	:- 

Product	: Oxford Health Insurance 

Technologies: Core Java, IBM RAD, IBM MQ, spring, oracle, Shell
Scripting, WebService.

Duration	: From April 2010 to till date.

	

Oxford Health Plans, a UnitedHealth care company, offers health care
benefits to employers and individuals primarily in New York, New Jersey,
and Connecticut.Â 

Oxford's commercial insured products and services include traditional
health maintenance organizations, preferred and exclusive provider
organizations, point-of-service plans and consumer-driven health
plans.Â  In addition, Oxford also offers Medicare plans and third-party
administration of employer-funded benefits plans.

EDI Health Care Claim Transaction set (837) is used to submit health
care claim billing information, encounter information, or both, except
for retail pharmacy claims (see EDI Retail Pharmacy Claim Transaction).
It can be sent from providers of health care services to payers, either
directly or via intermediary billers and claims clearinghouses. It can
also be used to transmit health care claims and billing payment
information between payers with different payment responsibilities where
coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory
agencies to monitor the rendering, billing, and/or payment of health
care services within a specific health care/insurance industry segment.

In This application I worked to validate the claim data like diagnosis
codes, Provider, Member. Presently involved in implementing the 5010
HIPAA changes.

EDI Health Care Service Review Information (278) This transaction set
can be used to transmit health care service information, such as
subscriber, patient, demographic, diagnosis or treatment data for the
purpose of request for review, certification, notification or reporting
the outcome of a health care services review. Presently involved in
implementing the 5010 HIPAA changes.

Claims Highway:- This is internal project in UHG. This initiative is to
deploy post-adjudicated claim data from the Oxford Claim/Intake
application to the United Data Warehouse(UDW) through the UnitedHealth
Group(UHG) Claims Highway (Claims Highway).

The scope of the changes:

Collect eligible Claim IDs from UniVerse

Obtain an Interchange Control Number (ICN) from the Claims Highway

Extract the ICN with claim data from UniVerse and PULSE into a payload
record

Transform the payload record into an Oxford Claim XML (OCXML) file

Route the OCXML file to the Claims Highway queue for Post-Adjudication
claims

Transform the OCXML file into a Common Framework Interface (CFI) format
recognized by the Claims Highway

Maintain transactional status history with the Claims Highway for the
claim

Maintain the ICN history for the claim

Resend the claim to the Claims Highway

Process transaction errors

Intelliclaim:-

The IntelliClaim software package C.O.P.S. (Claims Overpayment
Prevention Service) was purchased and installed to improve overpayment
protection and is designed to apply rules based on payment policies and
logic.  This software package will improve productivity and accuracy of
claims payment.  

C.O.P.S. provides real-time claim checking processes and background
historical claim record updates.   During the C.O.P.S. process,
real-time inquiry messages are sent from OXHPâ€™s application component
to the C.O.P.S. rule engine and then back to Oxford.  OXHP transmits
pre-paid claim information (from the EDI tables in Pulse) to
IntelliClaim for duplicate payment checking. IntelliClaim will return
the claim with Deny, Deny/Suspend, or Accept recommendations based on
the rules that were applied..  OXHP will use the recommendations when
adjudicating the claim.  OXHP will transmit adjudicated claim
information (driving from Master.Claim in UV) to IntelliClaim for later
use in historical payment processing.  

Responsibilities:

Involved in Developing Interfaces.

Performed Sanity Testing for every internal release to test team to
release bug free software.

# Project 2	:- 

Product: Universal Banking	

			

Description: 

BankFusion Universal Banking (UB) is a customer-centric core banking
system providing retail business functionality for both front and back
office. UB is a true 24x7 real-time transaction processing system that
removes the constraint of disabling all user interactions during
end-of-day batch processing.

I worked in following Modules.	

ATM:-

The Sparrow-BankFusion Universal Banking Interface is a client server
interface for ATM transactions. The Sparrow-BankFusion Universal Banking
Interface is the means by which transactions requested at an ATM device
and forwarded from the Sparrow sub-host system to the host BankFusion
Universal Banking system. 

Response messages are generated by BankFusion Universal Banking are
routed back to the Sparrow sub-host system via the Sparrow-BankFusion
Universal Banking Interface for onward transmission to the originating
ATM device. The Sparrow-BankFusion Universal Banking Interface is
designed to operate in a centralised multi-branch database configuration
in which each ATM device is connected to the Sparrow sub-host and the
sub-host is connected to BankFusion Universal Banking. The connection
between the Sparrow sub-host and BankFusion Universal Banking is
achieved using serial asynchronous communications protocol. 

Fontis:-

Fontis is a Third Party Product (TPP) used by BankFusion Universal
Banking customers (typically corporate customers) to access information
concerning their accounts over the internet. Fontis allows customers to
enter credit and debit payment requests to and from their accounts. It
also allows them to enter requests for cheque books and other
stationery. Details of a customer's payments through Fontis are
transmitted to the Bank and are formatted by Fontis into payment files.
These files are in ASCII format and can hold single /multiple debit or
credit transactions. Payments that fail validation are authorised or
rejected by a supervisor who views failed payment details along with the
error details. The authorized users are permitted accept / reject the
payment. All authorised payments are then processed again after the
error has been corrected.All payments that are processed successfully
are posted in BankFusion Universal Banking.

Core Financial:-

Core Financial is the core module for the Universal Banking. This Module
develops all the financial related Items like Interest, standing Order,
All Financial transactions.I Worked in the Interest Application
development and Standing Order Instructions.

Commercial Lending:-

My recent development is commercial Lending. Commercial Lending is a
feature for the Bank to give Different flexible options to the customer
in paying back the Loan.

Core-Non Financial:-

Core-Non Financial Module generally maintaining and creating static data
like Account And Customer. I Implemented the Customer creation with KYC
(know your customer).In KYC we will send the required data to the
FirocoSoft where it will identify whether the given customer is Black
Listed or Not.
