	  DESCRIPTION      	    : Banker Desktop Asia (BD Asia) is an online dashboard to provide the very quick access of necessary information about various portfolios of wealth management to the designated relationship managers (RMs). This summary information on single screens can be further drilled down for detailed analysis of specific transactions. This application is the replacement of existing system known as DB Traders (DBT). DBT was considered to be very slow in terms of accessing information. For single piece of information RM has to spent significant amount of time. Speedy access of information was the motive of developing this application. Application is successfully developed meeting all the expectations and undergoing User acceptance testing, and will be in production soon.

	  DESCRIPTION      	     : ADOE the abbreviation is used to define a project which is comprised of three different technologies. One is Java client to create Rules which can be applied on machinery or assets of a plant or industry. These rules applied on machinery generate alerts and events on the basis of current state of machinery. The data processed and collected can also be used for further analysis. We have reporting component of project for the same designed using crystal reports. Second the Managed code in c# to load the engine and process the real data coming directly from asset probes. And the third one is C++ which is used to define the framework for serialization and deserialization of data packets across multiple DHPs (Data Hub Plugins). DHPs are the bridge to communicate various data sources like SqlServer, PI, Echo, Postgre, Excel etc. 

	

	My role in this project is to design xmls for various plugins of it. I use spring to load all the plugins dynamically. Therefore to add a new plugin in the Java client the only thing required is a plugin directory at right place. I designed the Plugin Management and licensing for the project. Using Collections, Multithreading. Generics, Swing, awt and Jide soft completed various stories for java client. Written various unit and functional test cases using TestNG, Mockito and PowerMockito.

	  DESCRIPTION       :   NSDG will assume the role of a messaging middleware in the e-Governance infrastructure being worked out under the 27 Mission Mode Projects governed by DIT. One of the visions of the government is the need to coordinate, collaborate and integrate information across the different departments in the states and the centre, which would help in delivering the services to the citizens, businesses and other government departments in order to simplify government processes. It will provide common access point to SP and SAP to communicate information in a secured manner. SAP initiates communication with gateway by submitting a message to obtain service from SP, and gateway processes message and ensures its delivery to right service provider. SAPs are registered delivery channels, which would be an access mechanism for citizens and businesses, and SPs are enrolled services with the gateway. 

	

	I am involved in development and coding of Administration and Monitoring modules in this project. The module is aimed at designing a user interface for the controllers or administrators of NSDG project. It also provides assistance to NSDG Administrators to control all operations of NSDG, assign different roles and responsibilities to the different users of NSDG, monitoring all services and various users connected to NSDG etc.

	

	I also participated in Designing of User Acceptance Testing document for this project.
