the world. All these applications track the vehicle status, control
vehicle functions with the help of telematic device installed in the
vehicle. The applications code is migrated to Welogic server as it is
offering load-balancing, clustering, high security, connection pooling
et.c. 

Responsibilities:

Analyzing the code changes for Weblogic server migration

Coding the Weblogic configuration changes and building the applications

Checking Jboss compatibility for the original code

Creating maven build profiles for Jboss and Weblogic server
environments.

Unit testing the applications with JUnit and Mockito.

Deploying the applications in for Jboss and Weblogic servers

Documenting the code changes done (errors-resolution) during deployments

Committing the code to SVN repository.

them to appropriate portals based on caller intent. The marketing module
takes retail marketing calls to address marketing related(Products,
orders, delivery, bills) queries and sends them to appropriate portals
based on caller intent. The technical module handles technical issues of
customer, facing with the product. The routing module routes the calls
to an agent or any Self Serve portals. The downstream portals can self
server the caller or send to routing module. The routing engine sends
the caller intent to â€œCTI, ICM, Genesis componentsâ€, to get the
routing information. Based on the routing info calls will be routed to
an agent or suitable SS portal. If call failed to get routing
information, then it sends to default transfer queue.
