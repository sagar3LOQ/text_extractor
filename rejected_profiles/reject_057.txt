Projects Profile â€“ Past Company.

Project I: MDMS (Meter Data Management System)	                	

An MDM system performs long term data storage and management for the
vast quantities of data that are now being delivered by smart metering
systems. This data consists primarily of usage data and events that are
imported from the head end servers that manage the data collection in
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) or Automated Meter Reading (AMR)
systems.

An MDM system will typically import the data, then validate, edit,
estimate, cleanse and process it before making it available for billing
and analysis. The more flexible the MDM application, the better it is
able to integrate to existing enterprise applications and help to
streamline utility business processes. Benefits can be seen in billing,
customer service, outage management and analysis of utility operations.
